            Venice  is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals
            and linked by over 400 bridges.The islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave rivers 
            (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around
            55,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico) and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua 
            and Treviso, Venice is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area,
            with a total population of 2.6 million.<br><br>

            The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC.The city was historically the capital of the Republic
            of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area
            for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerce—especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century
            to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have been the first real international financial centre, emerging in the 9th century and 
            reaching its greatest prominence in the 14th century.[8] This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history.[9] For centuries Venice possessed 
            numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still 
            be seen today. The sovereignty of Venice came to an end in 1797, at the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city became part of the Kingdom of Italy.<br><br>

            Venice has been known as "La Dominante", "La Serenissima", "Queen of the Adriatic", "City of Water", "City of Masks", "City of Bridges", "The Floating City",
            and "City of Canals". The lagoon and a part of the city are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Parts of Venice are renowned for the beauty of their 
            settings, their architecture, and artwork. Venice is known for several important artistic movements—especially during the Renaissance period—and has
            played an important role in the history of instrumental and operatic music, and is the birthplace of Baroque composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi.<br><br>

            Although the city is facing some challenges (including an excessive number of tourists and problems caused by pollution, tide peaks and cruise ships sailing 
            too close to buildings), Venice remains a very popular tourist destination, a major cultural centre, and has been ranked many times the most beautiful city
            in the world.It has been described by The Times as one of Europe's most romantic cities and by The New York Times as "undoubtedly the most beautiful city 
            built by man".
