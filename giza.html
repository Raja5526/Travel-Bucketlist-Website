        <h3>Giza Pyramids, Egypt</h3>

            The Great Pyramid of Giza is the biggest Egyptian pyramid and the tomb of Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. Built in the early 26th century BC 
            during a period of around 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain largely
            intact. As part of the Giza pyramid complex, it borders present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt.<br><br>

            Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years.
            Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). 
            What is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of
            roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which includes an internal hillock.<br><br>

            The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of
            5+1/2   palms (a slope of 51Â°50'40").<br><br>

            The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes in total. The majority of stones are 
            not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from 
            the Giza Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from
            Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King's Chamber structure.<br><br>

            There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained 
            unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, that contains a granite sarcophagus, are higher up, within the pyramid structure.
            Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. Many varying scientific and alternative
            hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques.<br><br>

            The funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile),
            tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller "satellite pyramid" and five 
            buried solar barges.
