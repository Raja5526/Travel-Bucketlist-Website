            First documented in 1147, Moscow grew to become a prosperous and powerful city that served as the capital of the Grand Duchy that bears its name.
            When the Grand Duchy of Moscow evolved into the Tsardom of Russia, Moscow remained the political and economic center for most of the Tsardom's history. 
            When the Tsardom was reformed into the Russian Empire, the capital was moved from Moscow to Saint Petersburg diminishing the influence of the city.
            The capital was then moved back to Moscow following the October Revolution and the city was brought back as the political center of the Russian SFSR 
            and then the Soviet Union.In the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moscow remained the capital city of the contemporary and newly 
            established Russian Federation.<br><br>

            The northernmost and coldest megacity in the world, with a history that spans eight centuries, Moscow is governed as a federal city (since 1993)
            that serves as the political, economic, cultural, and scientific center of Russia and Eastern Europe. As an alpha world city, Moscow has one of 
            the world's largest urban economies.The city is one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the world, and is one of Europe's most 
            visited cities. Moscow is home to the seventh-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world. The Moscow International Business Center 
            is one of the largest financial centers in Europe and the world, and features the majority of Europe's tallest skyscrapers. Moscow was the host 
            city of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.<br><br>

            As the historic core of Russia, Moscow serves as the home of numerous Russian artists, scientists, and sports figures due to the presence of its 
            various museums, academic and political institutions, and theaters. The city is home to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is well known for 
            its display of Russian architecture, particularly its historic Red Square, and buildings such as the Saint Basil's Cathedral and the Moscow Kremlin,

            is served by a comprehensive transit network, which includes four international airports, ten railway terminals, a tram system, a monorail system, 
            and most notably the Moscow Metro, the busiest metro system in Europe, and one of the largest rapid transit systems in the world. The city has over
